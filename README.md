# scRNAseq of Allergic and Nanoparticle-treated Murine Intestines in OVA-alum Allergy Model

Data and study design is publically available in the NIH GEO Database at Accession ID: GSE300948 (Not available until paper submission)

Study Summary: Polymeric allergen-loaded nanoparticles (NPs) were used as a treatment for a murine model of food allergies. To study the immune changes due to allergic disease and NP treatment, single-cell RNA sequencing of the small intestine lamina propria (SILP) was done at various timepoints. This study investigates immune dynamics in allergic and NP-treated mice before and after OFC-induced anaphylaxis. 

- OVA-alum sensitization female BALB/cJ mice (Day 0 and 14)
- Treatment: i.v. OVA NPs or vehicle (Day 28 and 42)
- Tissue Extraction and Sample Prep: SILPs were harvested from OVA NP-treated mice on days 53 (post-OFC 4) and 60 (post-OFC 7) and PBS-treated mice on days 45 (pre-OFC 1), 53 (post-OFC 4) and 60 (post-OFC 7).  Each sample is pooled from 3-4 biological replicates. Pre-OFC 1 represents a pre-symptomatic timepoint before oral allergen exposure. Post-OFC 4 represents a pre-symptomatic timepoint after oral allergen exposure. Post-OFC 7 represents a symptomatic, anaphylactic timepoint, but OVA NP treatment greatly reduces OFC-induced anaphylaxis.
